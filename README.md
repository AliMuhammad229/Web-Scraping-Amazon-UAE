# Web Scraping Amazon UAE

This project aims to demonstrate how to scrape product information from Amazon UAE specifically focusing on the gaming chairs category. I will be utilizing the Beautiful Soup library in Python for web scraping.

## Prerequisites

To run the script, you'll need the following:

- Python 3 installed on your machine
- The Beautiful Soup library (`beautifulsoup4`) installed. You can install it using pip: ```pip install beautifulsoup4```
- Requests library (`requests`) to make HTTP requests. You can install it using pip: ```pip install requests```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: ```https://github.com/AliMuhammad229/Web-Scraping-Amazon-UAE/```
2. Navigate to the project directory: ```cd Web-Scraping-Amazon-UAE```
3. Run the Python script: ```python Web_Scraping_Amazon_UAE.ipynb```

## Customization

- You can customize the script to scrape other product categories by modifying the URL in the `BASE_URL` variable in the `Web_Scraping_Amazon_UAE.ipynb` file.
- You can adjust the parsing logic in the script to extract additional information such as price, ratings, or reviews.
